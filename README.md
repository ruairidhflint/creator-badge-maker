# Badge Maker

Deployed - https://badge.rory.codes/


Inspired by [Jakob Greenfeold](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/badge) and [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/) - a simple app
to generate the necessary code to create your own maker badge.

Currently supports creating a Twitter, GitHub or custom badge and can export plain HTML or a React Component.

Contribution towards Vue, Angular or any other types very welcome.
